# PySpark-With-Parquet-File
### What is Parquet File?
Apache Parquet file is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model, or programming language.

### Advantages of Parquet File:
Parquet is a columnar storage format that is optimized for large-scale data processing. Here are some advantages of using Parquet files:

* Compression: Parquet files are highly compressed, which means they require less storage space than other formats like CSV, JSON, or ORC. This makes it an ideal format for storing large datasets.

* Columnar Storage: Parquet stores data in a columnar format, which means that all the values of a column are stored together. This makes it easier to query and retrieve specific columns of data, without having to read the entire file.

* Speed: Parquet files are designed for fast data processing, with built-in features such as predicate pushdown and column pruning. This makes it possible to perform complex analytics queries on large datasets in real-time.

* Platform Agnostic: Parquet files are designed to be platform agnostic, which means they can be used with any programming language or data processing tool. This makes it easy to integrate Parquet files into your existing data processing pipeline.

* Schema Evolution: Parquet files support schema evolution, which means that you can add, remove, or modify columns without having to rewrite the entire file. This makes it easier to manage changing data schemas over time.

* Data Type Support: Parquet files support a wide range of data types, including nested and complex data types. This makes it possible to store and process data from a variety of sources, including JSON, Avro, and other data formats.

Overall, the advantages of Parquet files make it a popular choice for big data processing and analytics applications.
