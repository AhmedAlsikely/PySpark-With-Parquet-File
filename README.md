# PySpark-With-Parquet-File
### What is Parquet File?
Apache Parquet file is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model, or programming language.

### Advantages of Parquet File:
Parquet is a columnar storage format that is optimized for large-scale data processing. Here are some advantages of using Parquet files:

* **Compression:** Parquet files are highly compressed, which means they require less storage space than other formats like CSV, JSON, or ORC. This makes it an ideal format for storing large datasets.

* **Columnar Storage:** Parquet stores data in a columnar format, which means that all the values of a column are stored together. This makes it easier to query and retrieve specific columns of data, without having to read the entire file.

* **Speed:** Parquet files are designed for fast data processing, with built-in features such as predicate pushdown and column pruning. This makes it possible to perform complex analytics queries on large datasets in real-time.

* **Platform Agnostic:** Parquet files are designed to be platform agnostic, which means they can be used with any programming language or data processing tool. This makes it easy to integrate Parquet files into your existing data processing pipeline.

* **Schema Evolution:** Parquet files support schema evolution, which means that you can add, remove, or modify columns without having to rewrite the entire file. This makes it easier to manage changing data schemas over time.

* **Data Type Support:** Parquet files support a wide range of data types, including nested and complex data types. This makes it possible to store and process data from a variety of sources, including JSON, Avro, and other data formats.

* **Parallel Processing:** Parquet files are designed for parallel processing, which means that they can be split into multiple files or parts and processed in parallel. This allows for faster data processing and improved performance.

* **Compatibility:** Parquet files are compatible with a variety of data processing tools and frameworks, including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Drill, among others. This makes it easy to work with Parquet files across different data processing environments.

* **Data Compression:** Parquet files use advanced compression algorithms like Snappy, Gzip, and LZO to reduce file size without compromising data quality. This not only saves storage space but also reduces data transfer times, which is particularly useful when working with large datasets.

* **Data Serialization:** Parquet files use a binary data format for serialization, which makes it possible to store and retrieve data more efficiently than with text-based formats like CSV or JSON. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage, particularly when working with large datasets.

Overall, the advantages of Parquet files make it a popular choice for big data processing and analytics applications.
